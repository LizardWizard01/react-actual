                <p>Hi, my name's Stephen. I'm from Erie, Pennsylvania and I graduated from Erie High School in 2021. I am currently attending Penn State Behrend as a DIGIT major. Since I was in 3rd grade I knew I wanted to develop games as a career. That dream still lives on today, however I realize that my real talent is in Art. My goal now is to develop indie games mainly as a concept artist and designer. Besides art and game development you can probably figure out that I love to play videogames. I take inspiration from mainly Fantasy but I also draw from other themes. A few examples of my art can be found in my gallery so check it out if you like.</p>
